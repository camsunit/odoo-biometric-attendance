This is an old module helps to integrate the biometric machines with old server without using the local dabase. This works with the help of Biometrics Web API (https://camsunit.com/application/biometric-web-api.html)

It requires valid API license for the biometric machine


If you have cams biometric machines listed at https://camsunit.com/product/home.html, they can be directly used for integrating with audio using this module

If you are using machines from ZKTeco, ESSL, BioMax, Identix and more, then you have to verify at https://developer.camsunit.com/ and protocol update (https://camsunit.com/product/cams-protocol-update-for-enabling-api-to-biometric-attendance-system.html) has to be purchased along with the cams API license

If you need any support for integration, you can reach us in WhatsApp https://wa.me/919840981006 or sales@camsunit.com
